```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

### 3. Lint the Code

Ensure code quality by running the linter:

```bash
bun run lint
```

### 4. Build for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
bun run build
```

### 5. Preview the Build
